                            In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a
                            publication to be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a
                            news blog that's filled with content hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to
                            be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the
                            internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements.

                            Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32â€“3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum
                            (On the Boundaries of Goods and Evils; finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro
                            quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit is the first
                            known version ("Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants
                            to obtain it"). It was found by Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at
                            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia; he searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin
                            literature, a term of remarkably low frequency in that literary corpus.

                            Cicero famously orated against his political opponent Lucius Sergius Catilina. Occasionally the
                            first Oration against Catiline is taken for type specimens: Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina,
                            patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet? (How long, O Catiline, will you
                            abuse our patience? And for how long will that madness of yours mock us?)
